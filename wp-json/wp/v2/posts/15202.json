Naturally, it hosts one of the best and most enormous swimming pools. According to me, this is one of the best features of the villa. I visited Villa Amorzito during monsoon, so I didn&#8217;t get to take a dip in the chilly pool. But according to the house owners, the private swimming pool hosted by this villa is one of the best pools in Dona Paula.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wasn\u2019t able to take a relaxing dip in the pool but it quickly became my favourite spot at the villa. In the early evening, when the cloudy skies had taken a break from their dampening endeavour, I and my colleagues had the time of our lives at the pool deck. It is the perfect place to sit around and sip on drinks. If you visit this villa during monsoon, fret not! There is ample shade near the poolside to protect you from drizzles or burning heat.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Living Room at Amorzito<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The living room of this villa faces the pool, so if you visit this property with your young ones, you can keep an eye of caution on your children. Cherry on top is that the villa is covered from all sides to give you and your family the privacy you need. Another thing I personally loved about this place is the fact that it is not only surrounded by nature but also brims with it. Huge trees are planted in the villa to rope in the feel of flora. You can enjoy spending a serene time here, sitting on the comfy chairs and couch.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the living room, you will find soft and stellar seating arrangements, sufficient for your large groups. A 50-inch television set is at your disposal if you want to tune in to MTV. Or perhaps check up on news channels to know what\u2019s going on in the world. If you are a lone wolf and want to have a solitary time, the villa has your back. It offers plenty of books on various subjects including the history of Dona Paula. You can find yourself a secluded spot and have a peaceful time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h4>Artefacts on Display:<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The artefacts of this luxury Goan villa speaks volume about the class of this property. The marble flooring oozes grandiose as it reflects the warm lights back at you. In one of the rooms, you can find a table tennis table and set to nurture the competitive spirit of your group. Or maybe you can just have a gala time playing games with your loved ones. The villa also offers various other board games for recreational purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are visiting this Goa-based villa with a private swimming pool, you can expect yourself sitting on a couch, with your feet on the table, as you sip on warm and energizing coffee. Being the kind of person who enjoys his solitary time, I found myself fixated on the couch as dramatic melancholy coursed through my veins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking about being a couch potato, the bedrooms in this villa are as big as they get.
