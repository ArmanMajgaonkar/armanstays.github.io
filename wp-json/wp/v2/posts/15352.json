Both these areas have their own specialties. North or South, Goa is full of excitement and surprises! <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are visiting Goa, you should be fully prepared. Here is the quintessential checklist for having a great time in Goa:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What to pack for a trip to Goa?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packing for a trip to Goa can be quite confusing when you go out for a holiday trip or vacation. We often pack stuff that we don&#8217;t end up using. And miss out on things that you need for the stay. The thumb rule we use is that one should pack things according to the place they are visiting.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One should consider aspects like climate conditions. You can also pack depending on the activities you would indulge in. And most importantly, the number of days you are going to spend in Goa. So, here are a few things that you would need when you visit Goa for a holiday trip:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Mirrored Sunglasses<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Rubber Footwear<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Footwear for Photoshoots<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sunscreen and Conditioners<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Swimsuits and swimming goggles<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sarong \/ Multi-drape coverups<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Shorts and cotton trousers<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Dresses for some special events<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Hat &amp; Caps<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Umbrellas (depending on the weather conditions)<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Scarfs<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cosmetics like Lip balm<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Body butter<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Hairbrush<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Large tote bag<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Plastic Bags<\/b><\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Cameras with extra Battery\u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But packing up essentials for a trip is still the second step.

We can offer you the best villas to stay in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But to book a villa, you first need to know where you are going to make your camp.
