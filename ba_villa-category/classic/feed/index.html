										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="comment">This holiday home, named Ukiyo 427, is a stunning property that offers an unparalleled earthy charm. It is nestled amidst nature, away from the city&#8217;s prying eyes, making it an ideal nature escape. The brown wooden facade and cosy indoor spaces complement each other beautifully, and the villa boasts modern, wooden interiors. The property features a private swimming pool that overlooks the green surroundings and a living room perfect for reading. The designated barbecue area adds to the experience.</p>
<p>The property&#8217;s key features are its serene location amidst green verdancy, private plunge pool, and overlooks of gorgeous landscapes. For your comfort, the villa provides a generator, AC, Wi-Fi, barbecue kit, wardrobe, hangers, torch, geysers, towels, toiletries, medical kit, mosquito repellent, and secured parking space for up to 3 cars. However, please note that this is not a wheelchair-friendly or pet-friendly property.</p>
<p>The villa has three cosy bedrooms, all located on the first floor, with amenities such as king-sized beds, Wi-Fi access, and ACs. Two bedrooms have attached bathrooms. In total, there are two attached bathrooms and one common bathroom, all with geysers, towels, and basic toiletries.</p>
<p>The first floor of the villa has a spacious living room adorned with comfortable furnishings for up to eight people, a TV, and Wi-Fi. The dining area can seat up to nine people. Guests can relax in the private swimming pool, measuring 15&#215;12 ft. and 4.5 ft. in depth, and enjoy the serene surroundings. The basement features a barbecue area, and guests can also take a walk on the walking path or use the designated kids&#8217; play area. A temple is also located on the premises.</p>
<p>Guests do not have access to the kitchen to prepare their own meals. Instead, guests may ask the caretaker&#8217;s assistance, and ingredients will be charged as per actuals for the same. The kitchen is equipped with a microwave, gas stove, refrigerator, water purifier, toaster, and mixer-grinder. Crockery and cutlery are also available.</p>
