										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Planning a trip to Goa? Goa is a popular name that pops up whenever we are planning a holiday or staycation in India. It is a dreamy destination for every young travel enthusiast. And why not? Goa is famous for a lot of things. It has beautiful beaches, churches, historical monuments, and much more. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goa has around 25 beaches to attract global tourists.</span></p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-15356" src="https://ukiyostays.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/elizeu-dias-RN6ts8IZ4_0-unsplash-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="435" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While visiting Goa, one can go to either go to North Goa or South Goa. Both these areas have their own specialties. North or South, Goa is full of excitement and surprises! </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are visiting Goa, you should be fully prepared. Here is the quintessential checklist for having a great time in Goa: </span></p>
<h2><b>What to pack for a trip to Goa?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Packing for a trip to Goa can be quite confusing when you go out for a holiday trip or vacation. We often pack stuff that we don&#8217;t end up using. And miss out on things that you need for the stay. The thumb rule we use is that one should pack things according to the place they are visiting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One should consider aspects like climate conditions. You can also pack depending on the activities you would indulge in. And most importantly, the number of days you are going to spend in Goa. So, here are a few things that you would need when you visit Goa for a holiday trip:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Mirrored Sunglasses</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Rubber Footwear</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Footwear for Photoshoots</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sunscreen and Conditioners</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Swimsuits and swimming goggles</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Sarong / Multi-drape coverups</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Shorts and cotton trousers</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Dresses for some special events</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Hat &amp; Caps</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Umbrellas (depending on the weather conditions)</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Scarfs</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Cosmetics like Lip balm</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Body butter</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Hairbrush</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Large tote bag</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Plastic Bags</b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Cameras with extra Battery </b></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But packing up essentials for a trip is still the second step. The main step is to choose a location to stay at. Booking a place to stay comes first. And this can be a hassle too. But why worry when we are here? Call us to get a great booking experience. We can offer you the best villas to stay in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But to book a villa, you first need to know where you are going to make your camp. And it is a human tendency to get confused when one is presented with multiple options. But fret not. We help with that too!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Everything You Need to Know About Shivom Villa 2 </b><b><br />
</b></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two kinds of people in the world. One kind, who crave shiny water bodies and forgets about the worries of the world. Biding their troubles goodbye as they dive deep into the ocean. The other type feels that if they step into a water body, it will pull them in. But if you felt a connection with the first type of people then this blog is for you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shivom Villa 2 is one of the best properties in Lonavala. The surreally calm Pawna Lake sits peacefully in the refreshing and windy town of Lonavala. Tourists and locals wind up around this lake throughout the year to take a few natural breaths away from the busy city life. If you are someone who can only relax when their toes are dipping in cold water, as you breathe in the sensational scenery, this place is a must-visit for you. </span></p>

<h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Walk-Through of Villa Amorzito </span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Goa’s Villa Amorzito is one of the most colossal properties we have in our treasure trove. Naturally, it hosts one of the best and most enormous swimming pools. According to me, this is one of the best features of the villa. I visited Villa Amorzito during monsoon, so I didn&#8217;t get to take a dip in the chilly pool. But according to the house owners, the private swimming pool hosted by this villa is one of the best pools in Dona Paula. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn’t able to take a relaxing dip in the pool but it quickly became my favourite spot at the villa. In the early evening, when the cloudy skies had taken a break from their dampening endeavour, I and my colleagues had the time of our lives at the pool deck. It is the perfect place to sit around and sip on drinks. If you visit this villa during monsoon, fret not! There is ample shade near the poolside to protect you from drizzles or burning heat. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Living Room at Amorzito</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The living room of this villa faces the pool, so if you visit this property with your young ones, you can keep an eye of caution on your children. Cherry on top is that the villa is covered from all sides to give you and your family the privacy you need. Another thing I personally loved about this place is the fact that it is not only surrounded by nature but also brims with it. Huge trees are planted in the villa to rope in the feel of flora. You can enjoy spending a serene time here, sitting on the comfy chairs and couch. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the living room, you will find soft and stellar seating arrangements, sufficient for your large groups. A 50-inch television set is at your disposal if you want to tune in to MTV. Or perhaps check up on news channels to know what’s going on in the world. If you are a lone wolf and want to have a solitary time, the villa has your back. It offers plenty of books on various subjects including the history of Dona Paula. You can find yourself a secluded spot and have a peaceful time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Artefacts on Display:</h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The artefacts of this luxury Goan villa speaks volume about the class of this property. The marble flooring oozes grandiose as it reflects the warm lights back at you. In one of the rooms, you can find a table tennis table and set to nurture the competitive spirit of your group. Or maybe you can just have a gala time playing games with your loved ones. The villa also offers various other board games for recreational purposes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are visiting this Goa-based villa with a private swimming pool, you can expect yourself sitting on a couch, with your feet on the table, as you sip on warm and energizing coffee. Being the kind of person who enjoys his solitary time, I found myself fixated on the couch as dramatic melancholy coursed through my veins. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talking about being a couch potato, the bedrooms in this villa are as big as they get. There are 10 bedrooms in this villa. This includes two master bedrooms and eight regular bedrooms. The master bedrooms have king-sized beds whereas the regular bedrooms have queen-sized beds. All the bedrooms of Ukiyo-116 feature enough furniture for your group. This includes comfy chairs and coffee tables. </span></p>
